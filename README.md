# Not Spelunky
 
A not-very-efficient game I made based off Spelunky's procedurally generated level system. It takes very long to load and is very laggy in the higher levels. 

I could've continued working on this and iterated and built on the game mechanics (like bombs!) and more enemies. Background art also could use some spicing up. But, for now, I'll just leave this here.
